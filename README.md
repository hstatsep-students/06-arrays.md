### Introduction
In APCSA (Advanced Placement Computer Science A), we are learning about Java. Learning Java is somewhat similar to Javascript; so I am familiar with some of the code. In unit 6 we have been learning how about Arrays. It is like a container holding a certain amount of data, like strings and numbers. Learning this was quite easy because it is a similar concept to JavaScript. In this writeup I will be taking you through some of the challegnes I had when learning Arrays in Java and the questions I had trouble with in the exam. 

### Challenge 1
One challenge I had when learning about Arrays in java is trasversing through arrays. I had trouble with this becuase I didn;t understand how and when to use it. However after watching this [youtube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A31qPGH43Gw), I understood how it worked and when to use it. You trasverse through an array to go through each data in the array; this can include numbers and strings. It works by using a for loop and using the `.length` to go through each data in the array.
```Java
int[] num = {10, 20, 30, 40};
for(int i = 0; i < num.length; i++){
  if(num[i] > 25){
    System.out.println(num[i]);
  }
}
```
In this line of code there is a array that holds 4 different numbers. If you want to see if each number in the array is greater than 25 you will have to create a for loop that will go through each number and put and if statement. The code will print out 30 and 40 because they are greater than 25. 

### Challenge 2
Another challegne I ahd when learning about Arrays is 




### Challenge 3





### Challenge 4
When finished with the unit 6 materials, we had to take a unit test to test our knowldege in Arrays. In this test time was a challenge for me because I would sometimes find myself focusing on one questions for a long time and not having time to look at the other questions. In this challegnge I will take you through some of the questions I had had wrong and explain the correct answer.
